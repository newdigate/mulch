# OpenGL Shader Streamer

A node-graph media pipeline, in the spirit of Blender's shader editor. Wire
shader, audio, MIDI, and geometry modules together and watch textures, sound, and
3D data stream through the graph in real time. C++17 · OpenGL 4.1 · Dear ImGui.

## Build & run

```bash
cmake -S . -B build      # first configure fetches all deps (draco makes it slow)
cmake --build build -j
./build/shader_streamer   # run from the repo root
```

Most dependencies are fetched and pinned by CMake. The one system package is
**FFmpeg** (for the Video node) — install it first: `brew install ffmpeg` on
macOS, or your distro's `libav*-dev` packages. A network connection is needed the
first time for the fetched dependencies.

Two windows open, sharing one GL context: a **Graph** window (the node editor) and
an **Output** window showing the result fullscreen. Right-click the canvas to add
nodes, drag between pins to connect, and select a node or link and press
**Delete**/**Backspace** to remove it. Unconnected inputs show inline editors.

Try it: wire `Sine → Audio Out` to hear a tone and `Sine → Spectrograph → Output`
to see it; or `Mesh Loader → Shaded Render → Output` to spin a 3D model.

## Modules

| | |
|---|---|
| **Colour** | colour parameter → texture |
| **Video** | play a video file → texture + audio; signed `rate` (negative = reverse), variable speed, loop |
| **Mix** | blend two textures by a factor |
| **Spectrograph** | audio → FFT → texture (and a 3D line-strip vertex buffer) |
| **Sine** | pure sine-wave audio source |
| **Audio In / Out** | capture the mic / play to the default device (libsoundio) |
| **Audio Mix** | four audio inputs → one mix |
| **MIDI In / Out** | hardware or virtual MIDI ports (RtMidi) |
| **Step Seq** | 16-step drum sequencer → MIDI |
| **Arpeggiator** | held notes → a stepped sequence |
| **MIDI Merge** | up to four MIDI streams → one |
| **Mesh Loader** | load .obj/.gltf/.glb (incl. Draco/meshopt) on a worker thread → geometry |
| **Wireframe / Shaded Render** | a vertex buffer → a rotating wireframe / lit texture |
| **Output** | marks the texture shown in the Output window |

Texture nodes render a fragment shader into their own framebuffer; audio and MIDI
nodes carry samples and events; geometry flows as GL vertex-buffer handles. The
graph is evaluated once per frame in topological order.

## Test

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

`core_tests` covers the GL-free core (graph, FFT, signal, audio/MIDI, mesh edges);
`gl_smoke` renders graphs headlessly and reads back pixels.
